# Netflix Clone App

This Netflix clone application, built using React, replicates the core functionalities and user interface of the popular streaming service, Netflix. The app leverages modern web development technologies to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures smooth functionality across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Trending Content**: Uses the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch and display trending movies and TV shows, dynamically updating to reflect the latest trends.
- **Banner Component**: Showcases a randomly selected movie or TV show as a banner, featuring its backdrop image, title, and overview.
- **Categorized Rows**: Displays movies and TV shows in categorized rows based on genres and categories, mimicking Netflix's layout.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Each movie or TV show includes "Play" and "My List" buttons, enhancing user interaction.
- **Detailed View**: Clicking on a movie or TV show reveals additional details, such as its description, release date, and rating.
- **Clean UI**: Designed to be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate, closely resembling Netflix's look and feel.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TMDB API**: Fetches movie and TV show data.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for API requests.
- **CSS Modules**: Styles components.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/M0I0A/netflix-clone.git
   cd netflix-clone
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
